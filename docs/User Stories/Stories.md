# User Stories

## Logging In to Syncify
When opening the web app for the first time, either a button or pop-up appears that makes the user have to login/create account using an integrated Google Sign-in. Once a gmail account has been entered the pop-up transitions to ask the user what music platform they use (Spotify or Apple Music) and then log in to their streaming platform. A message will appear indicating that the user’s music account has been linked and can now add songs to the web app.

## Creating Playlists
A user clicks a button that will create a new playlist. When the button is first clicked, the user is required to enter a text field that will name the given playlist. Once the playlist is named, another textfield will pop up if the user wants to invite his/her friends to the playlist. The user will be given the option to give specific access to their invited friends (i.e they can only listen to the playlist or they can add and remove songs to the playlist). After friends are invited, songs can now be added to the directory.

## Viewing Playlists
A list of a user’s created playlist will appear on the side of the webpage. A user can view the songs in a playlist by clicking on it. Once a playlist is clicked, it will redirect the user to view the contents of the playlist. This page will show all of the users that have access to the playlist, all the songs in the playlist, a button that will add that given playlist to the user’s music platform, a button to add additional people to the playlist, and two buttons that will add or remove songs to the playlist. If a song is unavailable to that user’s music platform, then the text of that song will be visible, but  “grayed out”  to the user indicating that it cannot be added to their playlist.

### User Preferences
A preferences button will be located on the main web app page. Once the button is clicked a pop-up with multiple options will appear. These user preferences will include: email notifications, sign in/sign out, maybe an option to automatically update their playlist on their music platform when someone adds a new song, etc.
