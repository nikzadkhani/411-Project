This is the api layer for syncify. It is responsible for reading and writing to
the database and any other api level.

The best way to run this is using nodemon from the api directory:

  nodemon server

This server runs on port 4000. All api calls must start with a /syncify.

Here are the valid calls that can be made (see routes/playlist.route.js):

  / = this returns a list of playlists

  /add = adds a playlist

  /delete = deletes a playlist

  /update = updates a playlist (name only)

  /edit = returns a playlist object

  /addsong = adds a song to a playlist

  /removesong = removes a song from a playlist
